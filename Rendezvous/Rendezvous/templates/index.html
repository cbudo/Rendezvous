        Have you ever wanted to set up a series of interviews? Project Check-ins with your students?
        How about auditions for your music group? <br />
        We make it easy for you to do any of these!  Create an account and easily create a schedule of timeslots
        that you can send out to a list of emails - we make it simple, easy and painless! Once a user signs up for
        we send both of you a meeting invite so you can add it to your personal calendar! If either of you have to cancel,
        go through the web interface and we'll handle notifying everyone necessary.
